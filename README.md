## Overview

So, basically, this is Task 1 in the Concordium Hack hosted on Gitcoin and it involves installing and setting up Rust programming language, Concordium Web Wallet (Browser Extension) as well as interacting with the Concordium Testnet and claiming the free testnet token from the Concordium Testnet faucet. The necessary snapshots for the task are included in the submission folder...

## Installation and Set-Up of Rust and its dependencies

Here, downloaded Rust for Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and ran the installation file. 

I should point out here that I ran into a little bit of an issue with Visual C++ 2019 Build Tools because it was a mandatory requirement for Rust installation to get started on my local machine, but I don't think folks with Mac or Linux would encounter this same issue on their respective machines (snapshots included).

## Installation and Set-Up of Concordium packages (wallet, client etc.)

Followed through the document briefing for Task 1 and set-up my wallet passcode. Afterwards, I set up the Testnet Wallet address, claimed the 2000 CCD test token. Finally, exported the wallet address & account.
